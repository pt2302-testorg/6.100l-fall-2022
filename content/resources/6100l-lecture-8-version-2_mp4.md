    \nThis lecture further explores functions and their scopes and environments as\
    \ well as functions as objects. Functions are first-class objects that have a\
    \ type and can be assigned as a value, used as an argument for another procedure,\
    \ or returned from another procedure. Being careful about environments enables\
    \ the creation of concise, easily read code.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\n\
