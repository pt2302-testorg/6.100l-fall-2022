    \ Fall 2022\nInstructor: Ana Bell\n\nView the complete course: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/\n\
    YouTube Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP62A-ynp6v6-LGBCzeH3VAQB\n\
    \nThis lecture explains iteration in simple programs like guess-and-check, binaries,\
    \ and fractions in Python. Loops can iterate over any sequence of values including\
    \ a range for numbers or a string. Guess-and-check provides a simple algorithm\
    \ for solving problems. When the set of potential solutions is enumerable, exhaustive\
    \ enumeration is guaranteed to work (eventually). Binary numbers help us understand\
    \ how the machine works. Converting to binary will help us understand how decimal\
    \ numbers are stored\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at\
