    \nThis lecture explores list operations and mutability: mutation, aliasing, and\
    \ tricky examples with loops over L. Lists and tuples provide a way to organize\
    \ data that naturally supports iterative functions. Tuples are useful when you\
    \ have data that doesn\u2019t need to change, e.g., (latitude, longitude) or (page\
    \ #, line #). Lists are useful in dynamic situations, e.g., a list of daily top\
    \ 40 songs or a list of recently watched movies.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons\

This lecture explores list operations and mutability: mutation, aliasing, and tricky examples with loops over L. Lists and tuples provide a way to organize data that naturally supports iterative functions. Tuples are useful when you have data that doesnâ€™t need to change, e.g., (latitude, longitude) or (page #, line #). Lists are useful in dynamic situations, e.g., a list of daily top 40 songs or a list of recently watched movies.
