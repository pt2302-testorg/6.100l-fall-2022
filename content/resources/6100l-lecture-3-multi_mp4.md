An introduction to control flow and iteration through loops. Looping mechanisms include `while` and for `loops`. Lots of syntax today, be sure to get lots of practice! `While` loops loop as long as a condition is true and you need to make sure you donâ€™t enter an infinite loop. `For` loops can loop over ranges of numbers and elements of a string.
