## Finger Exercise Lecture 6

Assume you are given an integerÂ \\(0 <= N <=1000\\). Write a piece of Python code that uses bisection search to guess N. The code prints two lines: `count:` with how many guesses it took to find N, and `answer:` with the value of N. Hints: If the halfway value is exactly in between two integers, choose the smaller one.
