Implement the function that meets the specifications below:

```python
def all_true(n, Lf):
    """ n is an int
        Lf is a list of functions that take in an int and return a Boolean
    Returns True if each and every function in Lf returns True when called 
    with n as a parameter. Otherwise returns False. 
    """
    # Your code here

# Examples:
